# React App 

This React app is built with the create-react-app command. To create the UI components, I utilized the Rect component library Material UI. This web app fetches NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day using one of the open APIs provided by NASA. Each time a user refreshes the application, they will see 8 different Astronomy Picture of the Day posts. Users can like, unlike, and copy the link of each post on their feed. Each card on the feed consists of an avatar (NASA's logo), the copyright of the picture, date of the picture, image, and description.
